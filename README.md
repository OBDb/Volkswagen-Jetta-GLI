# Volkswagen Jetta GLI

This repository contains signal set configurations for the Volkswagen Jetta GLI, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Volkswagen Jetta GLI.

The Jetta GLI represents the performance sedan counterpart to the iconic Golf GTI, bringing the same performance-oriented approach to the Jetta platform. Essentially a "GTI with a trunk," the GLI has been produced across multiple generations since 1984, sharing engines, transmissions, and chassis components with its hatchback sibling while offering the practicality of a traditional three-box sedan design.
